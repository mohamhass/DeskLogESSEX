DeskLog: An application that produces a video log of your computer
desktop


The Project:
Many people spend a large part of their day working at the computer.
It would be beneficial to be able to review how the time was spent.
For instance, some people work on different projects or for different
clients at different times, and need to bill based on time spent on such
projects/clients.
Also, we are all a bit addicted to Web browsing, Facebook, etc. and we
might want to know what proportion of the day we devoted to this so
that we can learn to control ourselves.
In this project you will develop a video logging application that takes
desktop snapshots at regular intervals, adds a time stamp, saves them
and finally produces a video log.


Users will be able to choose the frame rate, the resolution of the video
and a dissimilarity threshold.
The dissimilarity threshold will be used to automatically detect changes
in the applications open on the desktop, which might correspond to
changes in activity.
The application will compare consecutive frames to see if they are
above the threshold. If they are, it will split the video log for easier
identification of activities.
If time permits, some simple form of image analysis (template
matching) will be used to identify the type of application open at any
given time (e.g., Word, Excel, Google Chrome, ....) and a textual log
containing this information will be saved, too.
